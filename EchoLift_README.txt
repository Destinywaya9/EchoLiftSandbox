# EchoLift Quantum Sandbox 🚀🌌

**EchoLift** is a conceptual quantum sandbox demonstrating a radiation-hardened quantum coherence model, optimized for space-based computing environments. This prototype was created as part of the **QCC Echo** suite and tested under simulated radiation injection with **100.00% Coherence Fidelity** and **0.000000 Entropy Leakage**.

🔒 Kernel status: **Embargoed & SHA-256 Verified**  
🛰️ Project intent: **NASA-compatible sandbox visualization and simulation preview**  
📡 Use case: Radiation-hardened quantum middleware demonstration (EchoLift concept)

### Features

- 💠 Quantum noise injection simulation (depolarizing error: 0.02, radiation mode)
- 🧠 Ideal coherence logic and entropy readout display
- 🌌 Fully responsive HTML/CSS-based sandbox UI
- 🔐 SHA-256 protected kernel execution record
- 🔭 Designed to preview the architecture of EchoLift

### Example Output (Test Run)

```
Entropy Leakage: -0.000000 bits  
Coherence Fidelity: 100.00000000%
```

> Simulated with injected radiation conditioning.
